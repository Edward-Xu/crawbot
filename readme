[Tests]
The test worlds used for this project are under April?? and worlds.
Test case worlds/homemade shows that crawbot is able to pick up balls
that are alone the wall and in the corner. Other worlds are used for
general testing. Assertions are placed in the source file to increase
system's correctness.

[examples]
one crawbot:
roslaunch crawbot spwan_onebot.launch world_file:="$path to world file" x:=-2.6 y:=2.6
roslaunch crawbot ball_retriever_onebot.launch x:=-2.3 y:=2.6

two crawbots:
roslaunch crawbot spwan_twobots.launch world_file:="$path to world file" x1:=-8 y1:=8.4 x2:=-9 y2:=7.4
roslaunch crawbot ball_retriever_twobots.launch x:=-9 y:=8
